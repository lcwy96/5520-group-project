    "The hospitality industry plays a significant role in the economic development of every nation, providing\n",
    "revenue to both national and local governments and employing many people. Further, many people\n",
    "derive their livelihoods and incomes from the hospitality industry. Like Lawson (2015) stated, hotels, a\n",
    "major player in the hospitality industry, serve the needs of travelers, business visitors, and tourists.\n",
    "Additionally, it serves individuals who need temporary accommodation among several other reasons.\n",
    "Data shows that the U.S. hotel industry employs about 2.3 million people and in 2018, contributed\n",
    "659.4 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product. Thus, it is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the\n",
    "hotel industry so that it continues to serve the needs of the people and to provide revenue and incomes.\n",
    "A few scholarly research works have been conducted around factors that could impact the sustainability\n",
    "of the hotel industry. For example, Wilkins, Merrilees, and Herington (2007) used exploratory and\n",
    "confirmatory factor analysis and structural modeling and concluded that customers rated quality of\n",
    "service as an important indicator for choosing a hotel, while Saleh and Ryan (1992, p.1) observed that\n",
    "‘availability of a restaurant, convenient parking, interior decor and exterior aesthetics’ were factors\n",
    "customers consider when selecting a hotel. While Su (2004) found that customers were not satisfied\n",
    "with their hotel services, Poon and Low (2005) observed that satisfaction levels varied among Asian and\n",
    "Western travelers.\n",
    "These studies typically used social science research techniques such as focus groups, surveys, interviews,\n",
    "and thematic and content analyses to draw conclusions. The sample sizes in the studies were relatively\n",
    "small, mostly ranging from 50 to 600 study participants. In this study, however, we aim to perform a\n",
    "more rigorous scientific analysis by relying on hotel data of 32 variables and more than 119,000 samples.\n",
    "According to a study sponsored by the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association and the American Hotel &amp;\n",
    "Lodging Educational Foundation, the U.S. hotel industry generated $42.4 billion in direct capital\n",
    "investment in 2018 and supported more than 329,000 direct jobs from the construction and renovation\n",
    "of hotel projects 2 . It is important to note that customers are critical in sustaining the hotel industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without customers to frequent the hotels, the huge capital investment injected into the construction of\n",
    "hotels could have a debilitating ramification for the investors. In addition, governments will lose\n",
    "revenue, jobs will decline, and livelihoods will be significantly affected. We contribute to the scholarly\n",
    "discourse on sustainability of the hotel industry by attempting to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Whether Asian or western travelers prefer city hotels or resort hotels?\n",
    "\n",
    "● If adult customers with children are more likely to cancel their reservation?\n",
    "\n",
    "● If guests with family have a higher reservation lead time than guests without families?\n",
    "\n",
    "● Which country’s citizens mostly prefer resort hotels?\n",
    "\n",
    "● What are the most preferred meals for guests?\n",
    "\n",
    "●What is the probability that the room the customer reserved will be assigned to them?\n",
    "\n",
    "● What is the meal preference for guests from countries with the most reservations?\n",
    "\n",
    "● If car parking space is a factor in deciding on the choice of a hotel?\n",
    "\n",
    "● What hotel type (resort or city) is mostly preferred by guests?\n",
    "\n",
    "● Which type of guest is likely to make special requests?\n",
    "\n",
    "● How does the average daily rate impact the choice of a hotel?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions could help unravel important factors that contribute to customer satisfaction and the\n",
    "sustainability of hotels. The findings of this study will be disseminated via journal and conference\n",
    "publications to contribute to the existing body of knowledge and to help improve the hotel industry in\n",
    "the United States and other countries that recognize hotels and the hospitality industry as an important\n",
    "economic sector for development."
